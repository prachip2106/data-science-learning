# Data Analysis with SQL & Python

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice as an **aspiring Data Analyst**, using **Python and SQL** to work with real-world style sales data.

The focus of this project is on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Writing SQL queries for analysis
- Integrating SQL with Python
- Calculating and automating business KPIs

All work follows an entry-level, industry-relevant data analytics workflow.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (MySQL)
- MySQL Connector for Python
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
